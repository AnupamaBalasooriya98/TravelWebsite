Legendary Sri Lanka is a Sinhalese and Buddhist country.But all nationalities and religious people live together as one nation called Sri Lankans peacefully. So Sri Lanka is a multi-religious, multi-ethnic country.
The village is built arround the temple, associated with lake and Pagoda. The paddy field enhances the significance because staple food is rice and curry. This union is the symbol of prosperity. The Pagoda is the symbol of Buddhism. It is very meaningful not only religiously, but also scientifically. Because of its shape and pinnacle can break the bond of Nitrogen (N) of made nitrate when the lightning. Nitrate mixed with rainwater flows down on the body and save water into the lake.

Page 1 - They can work hard
Villagers always try to cultivate something around their home. Most of them are self-sufficient from their foods. They cultivate plants only using compost and without any chemicals. They do not need to keep prepared food in refrigerators for a long time. Because when they want them, they can go to their home garden and pick fresh food and can cook. They always use fresh food. That is the reason for a healthy, long life. And also they do not use machines always to make their work easy. Most probably villagers use primitive tools. That is a better exercise for the body. Here I have added a picture of a paddy field. Now it is ready for harvest.
The villagers are very supportive of each other. The family members, friends, and relations gather to the field and harvest like this. They do not need many machines because they have a lot of manpower and primitive tools. They work together like this and share everything.

Page 2 - Better Things With Reasonable Prices
Local Sri Lankans are very innocent. They want to sell their crops to others. Small and temporary stalls built aside the road so travelers on the road can easy to see the things inside the stall. The villagers come out from their village towards the city areas to sell their crops. There are a lot of fruits, vegetables, various kinds of grains available on the stalls. Some fruits grow only in a special season.
Not only rice, but they also have a lot of things. They always ready to supply you with things that you request.

Page 5 - The tea lands
In Sri Lanka, the main commercial cultivations are tea, rubber, and coconut. Tea is categorized into three types. Those are,
		* High grown tea
		* Mid country
		* Low grown tea 
The categorization depends on the hight of locations of tea land which is measured considering the sea level. Tea grown on the lands which are locating above 1200m above the sea level are called “High Grown Tea”. The best example is Nuwara Eliya. That is 1892m above sea level. Because of the cold climate in this area known as LITTLE ENGLAND.
The tea lands are located between 1200m and 600m above sea level. That is mid-country. 
The tea land located above 600m from the sea level called as low grown tea.

Page 6 - Low grown **
Considering the culture, the family is very important. In the ancient family, there were a huge number of kids. Today it cannot be seen. It is limited up to two or three kids. At that time mother was the main character of the family. The family was built around the mother. She never did a job like today. Her main responsibility was feeding and taking care of the kids. Especially with a calm mind child. The responsibility on the mother's hand to build a thank full society did a big task. But that did not succeed without support from the father to earn money.
Look at this picture,
Actually this is a tea land in low country (low grown tea).This is a family employment. Most of the tea lands in low country are smaller, not like up country. But it is not without bigger lands.
Look at them, no any instrument on their hand, to pluck the tea. They use only their nails; nails are full of tanning, in brown color. Normally 18kg of leaves should be collected per the day the people who works as laborer in tea estate. Most of the tea plucker on tea estates is female. Normally they start early in the morning and stopped at about 1-1.30 p.m.

Actually, Sri Lanka is a smaller land with considering some other countries. Which has an area of 25,333 sq mi and population approximately twenty-five million. Most of the people are following their own religions. The majority is Buddhist. Others are Christians, Muslims, and Hindus. It can be seen in some places where Buddhist temples and Catholic Church are locating in the same place. But no any conflicts. Do you believe it? Because of some invasions of south Indian, step by step Hindu religion came into Buddhism. That is why today you can see some shine rooms are allocated for some Hindu gods in Buddhist temples those are known Vishnu, Paththini, Skanda, etc. Every ethnic gather to help each other when religious function happens regarding any religion. That is trusted by the people, the land full of blessings of Lord Buddha, Skanda, Jesus and Allah. That is why this paradise called religious land.
